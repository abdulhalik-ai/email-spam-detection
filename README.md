# Email Spam Detection using Machine Learning

## About the Project
Nowadays, we receive many unwanted and spam emails that waste time and
may even contain harmful content. This project is created to identify
whether an email is **Spam** or **Not Spam** using Machine Learning.

This is a beginner-friendly project developed to understand how text
classification works in real life.

---

## Project Objective
The main goal of this project is to build a simple machine learning
model that can read email text and predict whether it is spam or not.

---

## Tools and Technologies Used
- Python  
- Machine Learning  
- Scikit-learn  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Google Colab  

---

## Dataset Description
The dataset contains a collection of email messages. Each email is
already labeled as either **spam** or **ham (not spam)**.  
This data is used to train and test the machine learning model.

---

## How the Project Works
1. The email text data is cleaned and prepared  
2. Text is converted into numbers using TF-IDF  
3. A Logistic Regression model is trained  
4. The model is tested with new email messages  
5. The output shows whether the email is spam or not  

---

## Machine Learning Model Used
Logistic Regression is used in this project because it is simple,
efficient, and works well for binary classification problems like
spam detection.

---

## Result
The model is able to correctly classify email messages as **Spam** or
**Not Spam**. It gives reliable predictions for new email inputs.

---

## How to Run This Project
1. Open the project file in Google Colab  
2. Upload the dataset file  
3. Run all the code cells  
4. Enter any email message to test the prediction  

---

## Conclusion
This project helped me understand the basics of machine learning,
text preprocessing, and classification. It is a simple but useful
project for beginners who are starting their journey in AI and
Data Science.

## Future Improvements
- Try different machine learning algorithms  
- Improve accuracy with better text processing  
- Convert this project into a web application
